# Hi there, I'm Gabe 👋

I’m a second-year Software Engineering student passionate about both product design and software engineering. I design user-centered interfaces and implement them in Swift, and I’m looking for internship opportunities where I can grow as a designer-engineer and contribute to impactful mobile products.
