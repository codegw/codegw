# Hi there, I'm Gabe ðŸ‘‹

I'm a second-year Software Engineering student based in the UK, passionate about building iOS apps and creating thoughtful UX/UI experiences. 

My primary focus is on Apple platforms using Swift and SwiftUI. My background in photography, media, and computer science gives me a unique perspective on design and development, emphasizing visual composition and user interaction.
